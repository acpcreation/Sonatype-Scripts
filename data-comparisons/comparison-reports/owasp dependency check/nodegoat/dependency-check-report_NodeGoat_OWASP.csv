Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.  Sonatype's research suggests that this CVE's details differ from those defined at NVD.

The regex that validates user emails took exponentially longer to process long input strings beginning with `@` characters.  ### Impact The issue affects the `email` function. If you use this function to process arbitrary user input with no character limit the application may be susceptible to Denial of Service.  ### Patches The issue is patched in version 1.0.1 by improving the regular expression used and also enforcing a 254 character limit.  ### Workarounds Restrict the character length to a reasonable degree before passing a value to `.emal()`; Also, consider doing a more rigorous sanitizing/validation beforehand.",NPM,"","","","","","",HIGHEST,15,"","","","","","","",""

All slashes are normalized to `/` on Windows systems (on posix systems, `\` is a valid filename character, and thus left intact). 3.

These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.  The v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.  ### Patches  4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7  ### Workarounds  Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.  ```js const tar = require('tar')  tar.x({   file: 'archive.tgz',   filter: (file, entry) => {     if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {       return false     } else {       return true     }   } }) ```  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.  ### Fix  The problem is addressed in the following ways:  1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed. 2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.  #### Caveat  Note that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.  Users are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.",NPM,"","","","","","",HIGHEST,20,"","","","","","","",""

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.  This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\path`.  If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\extraction\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.  Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.  This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems.  ### Patches  4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9  ### Workarounds  There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.  ### Fix  The fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not ""absolute"".  Additionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions.  This is checked properly in the patched versions.  Finally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.",NPM,"","","","","","",HIGHEST,20,"","","","","","","",""

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`.   This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.   ### Patches  3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1  NOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.  ### Workarounds  Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.  ```js const path = require('path') const tar = require('tar')  tar.x({   file: 'archive.tgz',   // either add this function...   onentry: (entry) => {     if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {       entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)       entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)     }   },    // or this one   filter: (file, entry) => {     if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {       return false     } else {       return true     }   } }) ```  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.",NPM,"","","","","","",HIGHEST,20,"","","","","","","",""
