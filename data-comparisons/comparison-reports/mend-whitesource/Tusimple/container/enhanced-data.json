The `update_into()` function in the `ciphers.py` file unsafely allows immutable objects that implement the buffer protocol (e.g. `bytes`) to be mutated. A developer unaware of this situation may open a security risk by generating corrupted outputs.\n\n*Advisory Deviation Notice:* The Sonatype Security Research team has created a CVSS score that differs from the publicly available score that, based on our research, more accurately reflects the severity of the vulnerability."}, {"cve": "CVE-2022-40899", "description": "The `future` package is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The `http2time()` and `iso2time()` functions in the `cookiejar.py` file use unsafe regular expressions to parse time values from `Set-Cookie` headers returned by servers. A remote attacker with control of a server to which the application connects can exploit this vulnerability by responding with a `Set-Cookie` header containing a long string of repeating whitespace characters. Processing the attacker's server responses may cause the application to consume all available resources, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n*Advisory Deviation Notice*: The Sonatype security research team discovered that this vulnerability was introduced in version `0.3.0-rc1` and therefore does not affect all versions `0.18.2` and earlier as stated in the advisory."}, {"cve": "CVE-2021-41495", "description": "The `numpy` package contains a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to a NULL Pointer Dereference. The function and files listed below do not properly validate the return value of the `PyArray_Descr` function which could lead to a null pointer being assigned. An attacker who can influence the input to the affected function and exhaust the process memory can exploit this vulnerability to perform read/write operations from/to a NULL memory position thus resulting in a Denial of Service condition. \n\n*Vulnerable File(s) and Function(s)*:\n\nnumpy/core/src/multiarray/methods.c\n* array_sort()\n* array_argsort()\n* array_argpartition()\n* array_setstate()\n\nnumpy/core/src/multiarray/descriptor.c\n* PyArray_DescrNew()\n\nnumpy/core/src/multiarray/getset.c\n* _get_part()\n\nnumpy/core/src/arrayobject.c\n* PyArray_DescrNew()\n* _get_part()\n\n*Advisory Deviation Notice:* The Sonatype security research team discovered that the vulnerability is present in all versions before 1.22.2, not just 1.19 and earlier as the advisory states."}, {"cve": "CVE-2021-41496", "description": "The `numpy` package contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. The `array_from_pyobj()` function in the `fortranobject.c` file fails to perform boundary checks on the dimensions (`dims`) array passed into `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` calls. A remote attacker who can influence the values of arrays processed by this function can exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\n*Advisory Deviation Notice*: The Sonatype security research team discovered that the fix for this vulnerability was released with version 1.22.0 and not 1.19 as stated in the advisory. The research team also discovered that this vulnerability was introduced in version 1.3.0 and therefore does not affect all versions prior to 1.19 as the advisory states."}], "TotalWorkarounds": 10, "Workarounds": [{"cve": "CVE-2022-37454", "remediation": "We recommend upgrading to a version of this component that is not vulnerable to this specific issue.
