Test-Group,Webgoat_Pom-Comparison,dependency_scanning,gemnasium-maven,detected,Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling,"Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and very large content. This happens even with the default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).",,medium,CVE-2023-26048,,Gemnasium-3d81d28b-858f-46c7-9d77-fcf0e38dffb2; GHSA-qw69-rqj8-6qw8,2023-12-20 17:45:04 UTC,"{""file""=>""pom.xml"", ""dependency""=>{""package""=>{""name""=>""org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-util""}, ""version""=>""9.4.48.v20220622""}}",false,"",test-group260849/webgoat_pom-comparison/103365827,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L=NVD

Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `""` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=""b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d""` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system.

### Workarounds

### Original Report 

[RFC 9110 Secion 8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6) defined the value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits. However we found that Jetty accepts ""+"" prefixed Content-Length, which could lead to potential HTTP request smuggling.

Payload:

```
 POST / HTTP/1.1
 Host: a.com
 Content-Length: +16
 Connection: close
 ​
 0123456789abcdef
```

When sending this payload to Jetty, it can successfully parse and identify the length.

When sending this payload to NGINX, Apache HTTPd or other HTTP servers/parsers, they will return 400 bad request.

This behavior can lead to HTTP request smuggling and can be leveraged to bypass WAF or IDS.",,medium,CVE-2023-40167,,GHSA-hmr7-m48g-48f6; Gemnasium-ac117360-f9fc-41f2-81a1-91c357167451,2023-12-20 17:45:05 UTC,"{""file""=>""pom.xml"", ""dependency""=>{""package""=>{""name""=>""org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-http""}, ""version""=>""9.4.48.v20220622""}}",false,"",test-group260849/webgoat_pom-comparison/103365882,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N=NVD

Test-Group,Webgoat_Pom-Comparison,dependency_scanning,gemnasium-maven,detected,Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,"Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `""` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=""b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d""` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system.

Test-Group,Webgoat_Pom-Comparison,dependency_scanning,gemnasium-maven,detected,Stack-based Buffer Overflow,"XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.",,high,CVE-2022-41966,,GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv; Gemnasium-ba6d3974-133b-4394-8444-4be77a939be2,2023-12-20 17:45:06 UTC,"{""file""=>""pom.xml"", ""dependency""=>{""package""=>{""name""=>""com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream""}, ""version""=>""1.4.5""}}",false,"",test-group260849/webgoat_pom-comparison/103365936,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H=NVD
