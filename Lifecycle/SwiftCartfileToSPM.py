# This script converts a Carthage manifest file to Swift Package Manager format.
# This conversion allows you to take advantage of Nexus Lifecyce's dependency
# scanning and security evaluation by providing a supported filetype for 
# evaluation. Due to the overlap of libraries between Carthage and the Swift
# Package Manager we are safely able to do this conversion, giving your team 
# insight into which open source libraries are being used.
#
# Both Cartfile and Cartfile.resolved filetypes are supported.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Update the read file location
#   2. Update the desired file publish destination
#   3. Run this Python script
#   4. Run an evaluation of this directory with the Nexus Lifecycle CLI
#
